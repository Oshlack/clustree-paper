               large networks. Our method is a heuristic method that is based
               on modularity optimization. It is shown to outperform all other
               known community detection methods in terms of computation time.
               Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good,
               as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by
               identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone
               network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of
               118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy
               of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.",

  title    = "{Least squares quantization in PCM}",
  author   = "Lloyd, S",
  abstract = "It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM),
              with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values
              should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the
              signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by
              Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta
              becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per
              unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the
              probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In
              this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of
              quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that
              the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum
              finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization
              criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a
              minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into
              the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large.
              The optimum quautization schemes for2^bquanta,b=1,2, cdots, 7,
              are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution

  abstract  = "1. 1 Welcome to ggplot2 ggplot2 is an R package for producing
               statistical, or data, graphics, but it is unlike most other
               graphics packages because it has a deep underlying grammar. This
               grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson, 2005), is
               composed of a set of independent components that can be composed
               in many di?erent ways. This makesggplot2 very powerful, because
               you are not limited to a set of pre-speci?ed graphics, but you
               can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your
               problem. This may sound overwhelming, but because there is a
               simple set of core principles and very few special cases,
               ggplot2 is also easy to learn (although it may take a little
               time to forget your preconceptions from other graphics tools).
               Practically,ggplot2 provides beautiful, hassle-free plots, that
               take care of ?ddly details like drawing legends. The plots can
               be built up iteratively and edited later. A carefully chosen set
               of defaults means that most of the time you can produce a
               publication-quality graphic in seconds, but if you do have
               special formatting requirements, a comprehensive theming system
               makes it easy to do what you want. Instead of spending time
               making your graph look pretty, you can focus on creating a graph
               that best reveals the messages in your data.",

                 computational strategy to infer cellular localization by
                 integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA
                 patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851 single cells
                 from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and generated
                 a transcriptome-wide map of spatial patterning. We confirmed
                 Seurat's accuracy using several experimental approaches, then
                 used the strategy to identify a set of archetypal expression
                 patterns and spatial markers. Seurat correctly localizes rare
                 subpopulations, accurately mapping both spatially restricted
                 and scattered groups. Seurat will be applicable to mapping
                 cellular localization within complex patterned tissues in
                 diverse systems.",

  abstract    = "The development of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) at
                 the single-cell level has already led to profound new
                 discoveries in biology, ranging from the identification of
                 novel cell types to the study of global patterns of stochastic
                 gene expression. Alongside the technological breakthroughs
                 that have facilitated the large-scale generation of
                 single-cell transcriptomic data, it is important to consider
                 the specific computational and analytical challenges that
                 still have to be overcome. Although some tools for analysing
                 RNA-seq data from bulk cell populations can be readily applied
                 to single-cell RNA-seq data, many new computational strategies
                 are required to fully exploit this data type and to enable a
                 comprehensive yet detailed study of gene expression at the
                 single-cell level.",
