  author   = "Lloyd, S",
  abstract = "It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM),
              with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values
              should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the
              signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by
              Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta
              becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per
              unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the
              probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In
              this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of
              quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that
              the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum
              finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization
              criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a
              minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into
              the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large.
              The optimum quautization schemes for2^bquanta,b=1,2, cdots, 7,

              describe a droplet-based system that enables 3' mRNA counting of
              tens of thousands of single cells per sample. Cell encapsulation,
              of up to 8 samples at a time, takes place in ∼6 min, with ∼50\%
              cell capture efficiency. To demonstrate the system's technical
              performance, we collected transcriptome data from ∼250k single
              cells across 29 samples. We validated the sensitivity of the
              system and its ability to detect rare populations using cell
              lines and synthetic RNAs. We profiled 68k peripheral blood
              mononuclear cells to demonstrate the system's ability to
              characterize large immune populations. Finally, we used sequence
              variation in the transcriptome data to determine host and donor
              chimerism at single-cell resolution from bone marrow mononuclear
              cells isolated from transplant patients.",

  abstract  = "1. 1 Welcome to ggplot2 ggplot2 is an R package for producing
               statistical, or data, graphics, but it is unlike most other
               graphics packages because it has a deep underlying grammar. This
               grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson, 2005), is
               composed of a set of independent components that can be composed
               in many di?erent ways. This makesggplot2 very powerful, because
               you are not limited to a set of pre-speci?ed graphics, but you
               can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your
               problem. This may sound overwhelming, but because there is a
               simple set of core principles and very few special cases,
               ggplot2 is also easy to learn (although it may take a little
               time to forget your preconceptions from other graphics tools).
               Practically,ggplot2 provides beautiful, hassle-free plots, that
               take care of ?ddly details like drawing legends. The plots can
               be built up iteratively and edited later. A carefully chosen set
               of defaults means that most of the time you can produce a
               publication-quality graphic in seconds, but if you do have
               special formatting requirements, a comprehensive theming system
               makes it easy to do what you want. Instead of spending time
               making your graph look pretty, you can focus on creating a graph
               that best reveals the messages in your data.",

               gene expression profiling across complex tissues are lacking.
               RNA staining methods assay only a small number of transcripts,
               whereas single-cell RNA-seq, which measures global gene
               expression, separates cells from their native spatial context.
               Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer
               cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data
               with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map
               851 single cells from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio)
               embryos and generated a transcriptome-wide map of spatial
               patterning. We confirmed Seurat's accuracy using several
               experimental approaches, then used the strategy to identify a
               set of archetypal expression patterns and spatial markers.
               Seurat correctly localizes rare subpopulations, accurately
               mapping both spatially restricted and scattered groups. Seurat
